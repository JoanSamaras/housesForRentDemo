This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Design System

Custom design system with the help of Eva Design System (for the colours) and PXtoEM (`http://pxtoem.com/` for the conversion from px to em) while keeping a basic font size of 14px

## Editor and Plugins

I used VScode along with the default plugin for ESLint, but also a couple more extensions: Prettier ESLint, vscode-styled-components. Installed TSLint as well.
